            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Growing up in New Zealand, I spent a lot of my time focused on my passion
                for creative writing and english literature - it was only on my return to England in 2019
                where I undertook an A-level in computer science that I realised how inherently creative the subject
                was and began to consider it as a viable career path.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm still trying to discover where I'll fit in the diverse and exciting industry that technology has helped form,
                but my current interests are front-end development, software engineering and testing. I'm constantly looking for 
                opportunies to grow and develop, and hope whoever is reading this can come along on that journey with me!
            </p>
